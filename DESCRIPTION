Title: Grouped Missing Value Analysis for Data Quality Assessment
Version: 0.1.1
Author: [Swetha Srinivasaraghavan]
Maintainer: [Swetha Srinivasaraghavan] <swetha97@student.ubc.ca>
Description: A systematic approach to analyzing missing data in a dataset by
    summarizing missing values within specified groupings. This package is
    particularly useful for exploratory data analysis, allowing researchers
    and analysts to detect and visualize patterns of missing data across
    different categories or levels in a dataset.
    The main function, count_all_missing_by_group , calculates missing values
    in each column, grouped by a designated categorical variable. Users receive
    a summary data frame that highlights the count of missing values per group,
    enabling a streamlined inspection of data quality and aiding in decisions
    about data cleaning or imputation needs.
    This package is particularly useful for data quality assessment in fields
    like bioinformatics, social sciences, or business analytics, where
    understanding missing patterns can be essential to robust analysis
