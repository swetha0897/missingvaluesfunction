# Overview

This repository contains R functions designed to analyze missing data within datasets. The main function, `count_all_missing_by_group`, allows users to count the number of missing values (NAs) for all columns in a dataset, grouped by a specified column. 

#Installation
To install the package from GitHub, you can use the devtools package:
devtools::install_github("swetha0897/missingvaluesfunction")


# Contents

- **R Function**: The `count_all_missing_by_group` function for counting missing values.
- **Example Dataset**: Utilizes the built-in `airquality` dataset to demonstrate functionality.
- **Usage Examples**: Code snippets show how to use the function for different grouping scenarios.
- **Description** of the file can be found in the `missingvalues` folder
- **Function**  can be found as a `missingvalues.R` file in the R folder withint `missingvalues` folder
- **tests** folder within `missing values folder` includes the tests done on a sample dataset.

# Key Features

- **Group-wise Counting**: Counts missing values for all columns based on specified groups.
- **Flexible Grouping**: Supports both numeric and categorical grouping variables.
- **Clear Output**: Returns a data frame summarizing missing values by group.

# Pre-Requisites for the Repository

A basic understanding of STAT545 course would be helpful, as it will help to effectively use and adapt the functions provided in this repository. 

# Getting Started

To use the files in this repository:

1. **Install Required Packages and dataset**: Ensure you have the following packages installed:
   - `dplyr`
   - `tidyverse`
   - `airquality`

2. **Load the Function**: Source or copy the `count_all_missing_by_group` function into your R environment.

3. **Load Example Data**: You can use the built-in `airquality` dataset or any other dataset of your choice.

4. **Count Missing Values**: Use the function to count missing values based on your grouping variable.

# Contents of the Repository

- **RMD File**: Contains the code for the `count_all_missing_by_group` function along with examples demonstrating its usage.
- **missingvalues.R**: This R file contains the function code located within the 'R' folder.
- **tests**:Different tests performed for a sample Dataset using the  `count_all_missing_by_group` function
- **DESCRIPTION**:Contains all the necessary details of the package.

# Usage demonstration
```{r}
# Load the package
library(missingvalues)

# Example 1- Using the airquality dataset to count missing values by 'Month'
result <- count_all_missing_by_group(airquality, "Month")

# View the results
print(result)

# Count Missing Values by Wind Category
#First, create a new column to categorize wind speeds, and then count the missing values by the new Wind_category column:

# Create a new column for Wind categories
airquality$Wind_category <- cut(airquality$Wind, breaks=c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20),
                                 labels=c("Low", "Medium", "High", "Very High"))

# Example 2: Count missing values by Wind category
result2 <- count_all_missing_by_group(airquality, "Wind_category")

# View the result
print(result2)
#Count Missing Values by Temp Category
##In this example, we categorize temperature values and then count the missing values by the Temp_category column

# Create a new column for Temperature categories
airquality$Temp_category <- cut(airquality$Temp, breaks=c(50, 70, 80, 90, 100),
                                 labels=c("Cool", "Moderate", "Warm", "Hot"))

# Example 3: Count missing values by Temp category
result3 <- count_all_missing_by_group(airquality, "Temp_category")

# View the result
print(result3)
```
